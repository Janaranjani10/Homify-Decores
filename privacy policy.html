      <br>
    <h4> Cookies and other tracking technologies</h4>
      
    <p>Cookies are small text files that can be stored on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a browser. To enhance your online experience, we and our partners use "cookies", "web beacons" and/or other tracking technologies. The other tracking technologies work similarly to cookies and place small data files on your devices or display units of your activities on the Website to enable us to collect information about how you use our services or the Website.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Cookies and other similar technologies do a lot of different jobs, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. We also may work with partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used to analyze how our users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere. In the spirit of transparency, we provide detailed information about how we use these technologies.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We use cookies or other tracking technologies to identify you and your interest, to remember your preferences, to track your use of our services/the Website and to offer, improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services, and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit our Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience for our Services (for instance, to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We or a third-party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services, or advertisements on our Services or other sites. Please note, these cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (for instance, your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.
      </p>
      We, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners may also use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers, and partners provide more relevant advertising.
      <br>
      <ul type="circle">
      <li>Syncing Cookies and Identifiers: we may work with our partners (for instance, third-party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers, such as those associated with cookies, in order to match our partner’s uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send more relevant ads, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.</li>
      
      <li> Locally Stored Objects: our network services may employ locally stored objects and other client-side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies, or to target or help our partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics.</li> 
      
      <li> Disabling cookies: there are many ways to manage cookies and other tracking technologies. Through your browser settings, you can accept or decline cookies or set your browser to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, it will have an impact on your user experience and some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.</li> 
      
      <li> Interest-based Advertising: we may work with certain third-party companies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services. With the aid of these cookies, we measure matters including whether an advertising campaign is relevant to you or a specific target group. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may not affect such techniques.</li> 
      
      <li>Web beacons: we and our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an e-mail, to monitor the behaviour and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or e-mail. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns, for instance, open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.</li>  
      
      <li>Clear gifs: are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages..</li> 
      
      <li>Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs: we also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing,  or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits ("SDKs"), or use an SDK with a  mobile app that we offer, to collect information, such as Mobile IDs, and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Services/the Website and those using our Services/the Website. A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a web beacon.  The SDK is a computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown,  data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed. We may use these technologies, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the "Your Ad Choices" section below..</li> 
      </ul>

      <p>
      By visiting the Service/Website, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Our unaffiliated/affiliated partners and third parties may themselves set and access their tracking technologies when you visit our Services/the Website and they may have access to information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service/Website. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control and is subject to their privacy policies.
    </p><br>
    <h4>  In addition to cookies, other technologies that may be used include:</h4>
    <ol type="i"> 
    <li>  Pixel tags: (also called "clear GIFs" or "web beacons") are tiny images that can be placed on a web page or in our electronic communications to you to help us measure the effectiveness of our content, for instance, we use pixel tags to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns by determining whether you open and interact with the content in our promotional emails. </p>
      
    <li>  HTML5: (the language some websites, such as mobile websites, are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your website usage activities and to help determine how our Services are being used by our visitors, how the services can be improved and to customize our Services for our users.</li>
